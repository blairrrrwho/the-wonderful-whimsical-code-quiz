## Credits

This lovely, lovely JavaScript Quiz was created with the assistance of fellow classmates: BRANDON JOHNSON, CHRISTINA HALL, and LACEY ANGARITA. And, as the all-caps intends, they are very important to me and I am happy to have had them here for this app's development. I couldn't have done it without their support. 

I also want to accredit a tutoring session with Ms. Sandy and also with Mr. Kumar.
Let's also shout out the Net Ninja from YouTube, Ask BCS, and all of the other lovely resources we were given through this process. 

Thank you all! 

It's been a long time coming, and I'm glad to have had these resources to make it through.
