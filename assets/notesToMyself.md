# things blair wants to fix because she's crazy 

* when the timer ends, it doesn't end at 0; it ends at -1
* when the timer ends, it doesn't jump to the end game function
* the freaking buttons man... i just want them all to look the same 
* add clear button to last page to clear high scores
* add restart or reset button to restart or reset the quiz
* link the high scores hyperlink to the actual high scores log
* make.sure. that if the timer goes to 0, they absolutely lose
* theoretically we'd want them to get ponts for each question answered correctly and do it that way, but apparently that way blows the tutors' minds out the water and we use the time for scores here
* it's fine because a wrong answer is still bad
* but also just a few correct answers could be bad.....
* we will fix this in the future when javascript and web api's are second nature
