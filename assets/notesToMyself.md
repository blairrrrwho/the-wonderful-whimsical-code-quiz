# things blair wants to fix because she's crazy 

* when the timer ends, it doesn't end at 0; it ends at -1
* when the timer ends, it doesn't jump to the end game function
* the freaking buttons man... i just want them all to look the same 
* shuffle questions
* add clear button to last page to clear high scores
* add restart or reset button to restart or reset the quiz
* link the high scores hyperlink to the actual high scores log
* make.sure. that if the timer goes to 0, they absolutely lose
* theoretically we'd want them to get ponts for each question answered correctly and do it that way, but apparently that way blows the tutors' minds out the water and we use the time for scores here
* it's fine because a wrong answer is still bad
* but also just a few correct answers could be bad.....
* we will fix this in the future when javascript and web api's are second nature

* we ened to add padding and style to the high score page
* the weird numbers on the buttons

## Grading Notes
Hi Blair, Congratulations on an outstanding homework challenge! You were able to demonstrate your ability to build a Quiz application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Nice work! However, somethings I would recommend are: give you users an actual score based upon the answers they get correct -- not the time left on the timer. Additionally, style the buttons, and clean up your ReadMe. If a section is N/A, go ahead and take it out of the ReadMe. Over all great job and keep up the good work! Happy coding.
